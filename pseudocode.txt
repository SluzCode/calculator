When number key is pressed{
pass number key value to array for screen
update screen display by appending number to array

look up adding number to array and then flattening array
to string to pass to screen element

}

***remove percent and add Clear button next to All Clear***

When operator key is pressed
obtain screen string
convert to number
store as input

if (operator == clear) && (screen has input) {
        clear screen to correct error
        return
    else if (screen is clear)&& (operator == clear){ 
        clear last operator
        return
     {
    else if (no operator && screen clear){
        do nothing
    }
    else if (operator == AC)
        clear everything
    }
    else if (no input exists){
        store screen as input 1
    else if input 1 exists{
        store screen as input 2
        return
        }
    else if (both exist) && (input is operator) || (input is equal key){
        apply operation
        store output as input 1 and send to screen
        clear input 2
        return
    }
}
    }


function isValidInput(){
    *use object here?

    if input key is in object
        apply it
        return
    else return
}




function sendToScreen()
    get current screen as array
    append number to said array
    set screen to new array
look up adding number to array and then flattening array
to string to pass to screen element

}

code rework:

maybe just have input2 update continuously with each button press once input one has been set
